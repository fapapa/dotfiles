# Initial Arch Meeting for ${1:TICKET-NUMBER} ${2:FEATURE-TITLE}

### Attendees

* ${3:Developer}

### Agenda

${4:Add a rough description of what the arch meeting will be about}

# Questions

${0:Make a list of questions you would like to specifically have answered. This section encourages the
developer who called the meeting to come with a prepared list of questions which usually decreases the overall
length of the meeting significantly.}

# Discussion Points

Take notes during the meeting and make sure and write down topics discussed and any specific reasoning behind
said decisions.

# Next Steps

This section should be filled out towards the end of the meeting to distill the discussion into action items
and can be cleaned up after the conclusion of the meeting

Things like splitting up the work into smaller tasks or separate PRs, special actions need to make it all work
(LaunchDarkly flags),

example:
- Create migration PR and get that approved/merged first
- Create code changes PR to add the needed methods to the model, specs, factories, etc.
- Create launch darkly flag call <name-goes-here>
- Find answers to question X & Y that require input from Product/DataScience/whatever

# Finally, once the notes have been cleaned up and organized. Please post this entire file as a comment or in the description of the Jira ticket.
